### Prerequisites for Setting Up a Project

Before you embark on setting up your project with Zelthy, there are certain prerequisites that need to be met. One of the crucial prerequisites is the setup of a PostgreSQL database. Here's a brief guide on what needs to be done:

### PostgreSQL Database Setup

Run the below command in your terminal to create a postgres container

```bash
docker run -d \
    --name <db_name> \                          
    -p 5432:5432 \
    -e POSTGRES_USER=<username> \
    -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<password> \
    -e POSTGRES_DB=<db_name> \
    postgres:latest
```

ex:

```bash
docker run -d \
    --name zelthy_postgres_db \                          
    -p 5432:5432 \
    -e POSTGRES_USER=zelthy_admin \
    -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=zelthy3pass \
    -e POSTGRES_DB=zelthy_db \
    postgres:latest
```

## Setting Up the Project

Setting up your project with Zelthy is a straightforward process. Follow these steps to create your project's root folder, initialize the project, and configure the necessary settings:

#### 1. Choose a Directory:

Navigate to the directory where you want to create your project's root folder. You can use your preferred file explorer or the command line to create and navigate to this directory.

#### 2. Install Zelthy and Start a New Project:

After installing Zelthy, you can use the `zelthy3 start-project` command to initiate the creation of a new project. Replace `"MyFirstProject"` with your preferred project name.

```bash
zelthy3 start-project "MyFirstProject"
```

#### 3. Provide Database Credentials:

During the project setup, you'll be prompted to provide your PostgreSQL database credentials. These credentials include:

- **Database Name**
- **Database Username**
- **Database Password**
- **Database Host**
- **Database Port** (default is usually 5432)

If the provided credentials are incorrect or if there are issues with the database connection, the setup process will throw errors and cancel the project creation. This is because Zelthy will create schemas and perform migrations during the project's creation.

#### 4. Migrate Schemas and Create Public Tenant:

Upon successful database connection, the setup process will automatically migrate schemas and create a public tenant. This ensures that your project is ready to go with the necessary database structure.

#### 5. Configure Default Platform User:

Next, you'll be asked to provide details for the default platform user. This user serves as the first administrator and will have access to App Panel, where you can begin creating apps. You'll need to provide the following information:

- **Platform User Email Address**
- **Password**
- **Password Confirmation**

Once you've entered these details, the setup process will create the default platform user for your project.

#### 6. Project Folder Structure and Boilerplate Code:

With all the necessary configurations in place, the setup process will proceed to create your project's folder structure and populate it with boilerplate code. You're now ready to start developing your healthcare apps within the Zelthy platform.

##### Project Structure
```plaintext
project_name/                  # Project root directory
├── manage.py                  # Django command-line utility for administrative tasks
└── project_name/              # Django project package
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── asgi.py                # ASGI config for the project
    ├── settings.py            # Project settings (database, static files, etc.)
    ├── urls_public.py         # Public URL patterns
    ├── urls_tenant.py         # Tenant-specific URL pattern
    ├── urls.py                # Project-level URL patterns
    └── wsgi.py                # WSGI config for the project
```

Follow this guide, and you'll be well on your way to creating powerful and efficient healthcare applications using Zelthy.


## Running the Development Server

Now that you've set up your project using Zelthy, the next step is to start the development server. This server allows you to access App Panel, where you can begin creating your healthcare apps. Follow these steps to run the development server:

#### 1. Navigate to Your Project Folder:

Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you created your project's root folder. You can use the `cd` (change directory) command to move to the project directory. For example:

```bash
cd path/to/your/project
```

Replace `path/to/your/project` with the actual path to your project folder.

#### 2. Start the Development Server:

Once you're inside the project folder, you can start the development server using the following command:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

This command will initiate the development server, and you'll see output indicating that the server is running. By default, the server will be available at `http://localhost:8000/`.

Running the development server is a crucial step in your project setup, as it provides you with a local environment for app development and testing.

# Using Docker to Create Zelthy Projects

This guide outlines the steps to create and develop Zelthy projects without the need for local installations.

# Develop

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine. If not, you can follow the installation instructions for [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

## Steps

1. Clone the Zelthy3 repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/zelthy/zelthy3.git
    cd zelthy3
    ```

2. Run the following command from the root folder of the project:

    ```bash
    python zel_setup.py --build_core
    ```

    Use the `--build_core` option to build the Zelthy library for the first time. Subsequent projects can omit this step.

3. This creates a project named `zelthy_project` in the `zproject` folder in the same directory.

4. Customize the project creation using optional arguments:

    ```bash
    python zel_setup.py --project_name my_project --project_dir /path/to/my_project --server runserver --build_core --platform_username user@example.com --platform_user_password secret --skip_build_project
    ```

    - `--project_name`: Modifies the name of the project (Default: `zelthy_project`).
    - `--project_dir`: Specifies the directory for project creation (Default: `zproject`).
    - `--build_core`: Builds the Zelthy library (Default: `False`).
    - `--platform_username`: The user email of the platform user (Default: `zelthy@mail.com`).
    - `--platform_user_password`: The password for the platform user (Default: `Zelthy@123`).
    - `--skip_build_project`: Skips building the project (Default: `False`).
    - `--start`: Starts the project as soon as it is created (Default: `False`)

5. To install any Zelthy package, add `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` to the `.env` file created in the `project_dir` and restart the containers.

6. Subsequently, you can use `docker compose up` from the `project_dir` to start the project.


# Rebuilding Core

If you modify somehting in the core of the project, to rebuild it run the following command from the root of the zelthy3 project

```bash
python zel_setup.py --project_dir <project_dir> --rebuild_core
```

you can then run `docker compose up` from the project directory to start the project

# Syncing Static Files

You can sync static files by running `python manage.py collectstatic` from the project directory in the `<project>-app-1` container. Make sure to sync the static files before deploying

# Deploy

The necessary docker compose, nginx and gunicorn files to deploy your project are created in the project directory you can use it to deploy your apps easily

## Steps

- Replace `${PROJECT_NAME}` with your project name in the following files
    - `config/nginx.conf`
    - `prod.dockerfile`
- Change the `CORS_ORIGIN_WHITELIST` and `CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS` in the project settings to appropriate domain configured
- Start the production server by running the two commands
    ```bash
    docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml build
    docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up
    ```
- You can access your server at `http://<domain>:1443` (By default the domain is localhost)
