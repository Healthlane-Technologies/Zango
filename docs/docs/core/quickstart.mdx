# Overview
**Zango** is a Django meta-framework designed to streamline the development of high-quality, custom business applications that are enterprise-ready by default. It significantly reduces development effort in the following key areas:
- **App Basics**: Essential building blocks for business applications—such as User Management, Access Control, Audit Logging, and Release Management—are productized at the framework level.
- **Enterprise Readiness**: Security requirements are baked into the framework, ensuring applications are secure by default.
- **Package Ecosystem**: Applications can leverage an ecosystem of packages serving as functional building blocks, drastically reducing the need for custom code.
- **CodeAssist**: Application boilerplates can be developed within minutes through our LLM based CodeAssist, so you do not have to start from scratch.

## Before You Start
Building applications with Zango requires a basic working knowledge of Django. You should be familiar with the following concepts:
- **MVP Framework Basics**: A general understanding of Model-View-Presenter architecture.
- **Django Fundamentals**: Concepts like [Models](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/topics/db/models/), [Views](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/#the-view-layer), and [Routing](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/topics/http/urls/).
- **Frontend Experience**: Not necessary! You can define most of your web views with simple python classes in Zango. However this is not a limitation, you are free to drop in your favourite frontend as well.

## What Kind of Applications Is Zango Best Suited For?
While you can build any type of web application with Zango, it truly excels at applications that support **custom business workflows** (Think of applications that support any business function). These are typically CRUD-heavy applications involving custom objects and workflows that need to adapt to specific organizational requirements.
