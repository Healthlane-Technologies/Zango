# Enterprise Readiness in Zango


Zango is designed to enable enterprise readiness by default. If you intend to build robust and secure 
business applications, Zango offers a suite of features out-of-the-box to meet stringent enterprise 
requirements. We highlight Zangoâ€™s enterprise-ready capabilities and the mechanisms that ensure your 
applications are secure, compliant, and production-ready.

----------
### Application Security
Zango prioritizes security as a first-class feature, providing robust mechanisms to safeguard your applications against common vulnerabilities and threats. Below are the core security features offered by default:
#### **1. Access Log**
-   Tracks and logs all user access to the application, providing visibility into who accessed what and when.
-   Facilitates monitoring and compliance auditing through the App Panel
#### **2. Audit Logs**
-   Comprehensive logging of all application as well as framework objects
-   Helps ensure accountability and traceability for every action.
- Easy access of the audit logs through the App Panel.
#### **3. Access Control**
-   All views that you create in Zango are blocked by default, enforcing the principle of zero trust in your application.
-   Access is explicitly granted through policies, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.
-
#### **4. Debug Mode Verification**
-   Ensures `DEBUG = False` in production environments to prevent sensitive information leakage.
#### **5. IP Restriction**
-   Restricts access to App Panel based on configured IP whitelists.
-   Displays a list of allowed IPs for transparency.
#### **6. Account Lockout**
-   Implements account lockout mechanisms after a configurable number of failed login attempts.
-   Displays the lockout duration to inform administrators.
#### **7. Allowed Password Attempts**
-   Sets a limit on failed login attempts to mitigate brute-force attacks.
#### **8. Password Policies**
-   **Password Age:** Enforces maximum password age, prompting users to update passwords periodically.
-   **Password Strength:** Mandates complex passwords with defined length and character requirements.
#### **9. HTTPS Enforcement**
-   Ensures that HTTPS-only is enforced for all requests, securing data in transit.
#### **10. No Default Credentials**
-   Validates that no default IDs or passwords are active in production environments.
#### **11. Concurrent Sessions Disabled**
-   Prevents multiple concurrent sessions per user to mitigate session hijacking risks.
----------
### Web Application Security
#### **1. XSS Protection**
-   Configures HTTP response headers (e.g., `X-XSS-Protection`) to mitigate cross-site scripting attacks.
#### **2. Content Security Policy (CSP)**
-   Enforces CSP to prevent data injection attacks such as XSS by specifying trusted sources for scripts and other resources.
#### **3. SQL Injection Protection**
-   Uses prepared statements and ORM protections to guard against SQL injection vulnerabilities.
#### **4. Clickjacking Protection**
-   Implements `X-Frame-Options` headers to prevent clickjacking attacks.
#### **5. Secure Cookies**
-   Sets secure and `HttpOnly` flags for cookies to prevent JavaScript access and ensure they are transmitted only over HTTPS.
----------
### API Security
#### **1. API Rate Limiting**
-   Enforces rate-limiting on API endpoints to mitigate brute-force attacks and prevent denial-of-service (DoS) incidents.
#### **2. Data Encryption in Transit**
-   Encrypts data in transit using TLS, ensuring secure communication between clients and servers.
#### **3. Security Headers Compliance**
-   Includes essential HTTP headers such as:
    -   `Strict-Transport-Security`
    -   `X-Content-Type-Options`
    -   `Referrer-Policy`
#### **4. External Resource Control**
-   Validates that only trusted and necessary external resources are allowed, minimizing exposure to supply chain attacks.
----------
### Audit and Monitoring
-   **Comprehensive Audit Logging:** Captures critical user and system actions for compliance and forensic analysis.
-   **Access Visibility:** Provides detailed insights into system access and activities.
-   **Automated Alerts:** Future support for integrating alerts for suspicious activities.
----------
By adopting Zango, you empower your business with a framework that is built for secure, enterprise-grade applications.
