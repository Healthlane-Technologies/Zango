Zango is a multi-tenant Django Framework enabling fast development and secure and cost effective hosting of business apps. 


![Framework Architecture](/img/Architecture_Diagram.png)


Here's an overview of the key capabilities:

#### 1. Foundational Capabilities:
The underlying architecture is engineered to provide a robust and scalable foundation for application development and management. 
The platform offers essential, reusable elements for any business application, including App Lifecycle Management, 
[User Management](../core/user-management/overview) , [Role-Based Access Controls](../core/user-roles/overview), 
and a Detailed [Permissions Framework](../core/permission-framework/overview), available off-the-shelf for 
immediate use. Furthermore, rich industry focussed [package ecosystem](../core/packages-ecosystem/overview) 
allows rapid development of bespoke apps. 


#### 2.  Unlimited Customizability: 
The platform allows for unlimited customization, allowing for the creation of applications tailored to the specific 
needs of the healthcare industry. The customization layer is well orchestrated within the platform and managed by 
common compliance and [permissions framework](../core/permission-framework/overview), thereby ensuring that compliance of the app remains intact even with customization.


#### 3. Data Isolation and Privacy: 
Emphasizing data security and privacy, the platform incorporates advanced [data isolation techniques](../core/modules/overview). This allows for 
multiple tenants to operate independently within the same environment, ensuring data integrity and confidentiality.


#### 4.  Advanced Access Control:
Access control is paramount, especially in sensitive sectors like healthcare. Our architecture includes an advanced 
[policy](../core/permission-framework/policies/overview) and [permission framework](../core/permission-framework/permissions/overview) that meticulously governs access, ensuring compliance with stringent security standards.


#### 5.  Dynamic Application Management:
The platform offers dynamic application management capabilities, allowing for real-time updates and modifications
 without impacting the overall system. This feature ensures continuous operations, adapting quickly to changing requirements.


#### 6.  Rapid Development Toolkit/ Packages Ecosystem:
To accelerate development cycles, the platform integrates a suite of reusable components and packages. These tools 
enable rapid deployment of common functionalities, reducing the time-to-market for new features.


#### 7.  Enhanced Security and Compliance:
The architecture includes a dedicated layer for security and compliance, ensuring that all operations adhere to 
the highest standards required in healthcare. This layer safeguards sensitive patient data and aligns with regulatory
requirements.


#### 8.  Designed for Interoperability: 
Designed to interact effortlessly with external systems and APIs, the platform facilitates integrations with a 
range of healthcare systems and third-party services, enhancing its utility and reach.
