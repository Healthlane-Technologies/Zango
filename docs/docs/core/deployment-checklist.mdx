# Zango Deployment Checklist

This checklist ensures that the **Zango** application is deployed securely and follows best practices. Before deploying, review the following key areas.

## **1. Security Configuration**

- **Debug Mode**: Ensure `DEBUG = False` in production.
- **IP Restriction**: Restrict App Panel access to approved IP addresses.
- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Enforce 2FA for all user accounts.
- **Single Sign-On (SSO/OIDC)**: Verify if SSO/OIDC authentication is enforced.
- **Default Credentials**: Ensure no default IDs or passwords are active in production.
- **Concurrent Sessions**: Disable concurrent sessions to prevent session hijacking.

## **2. Authentication & Access Controls**

- **Account Lockout Time**: Set and verify the duration of account lockouts after failed login attempts.
- **Allowed Password Attempts**: Define and enforce a limit for failed login attempts.
- **Password Age Policies**: Ensure password expiration policies are enforced.
- **Password Strength Policies**: Require strong passwords (length, complexity, special characters, etc.).

## **3. Network & Communication Security**

- **HTTPS Enforcement**: Ensure HTTPS is strictly enforced.
- **Data Encryption in Transit**: Verify that all data transmissions use TLS encryption.
- **Server Time Synchronization**: Ensure the server is synchronized with an NTP server.

## **4. Web Security & Protection**

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Protection**: Enable XSS protection headers (e.g., `X-XSS-Protection`).
- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Define a CSP to mitigate data injection attacks like XSS.
- **SQL Injection Protection**: Use prepared statements or ORM security features to prevent SQL injection.
- **Clickjacking Protection**: Set `X-Frame-Options` headers to prevent clickjacking.
- **Security Headers Compliance**: Ensure essential HTTP security headers are set:
  - `Strict-Transport-Security`
  - `X-Content-Type-Options`
  - `Referrer-Policy`

## **5. API & Application Security**

- **Secure Cookies**: Set cookies with `Secure` and `HttpOnly` flags to prevent unauthorized access and ensure they are transmitted only over HTTPS.
- **API Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting on API endpoints to mitigate brute-force and DoS attacks.
- **External Resources Control**: Allow only trusted external resources (e.g., JavaScript libraries, stylesheets) to be used.

## **6. Logging & Monitoring**

- **Audit Logging**: Enable logging for critical actions, including:
  - Login attempts
  - Password changes
  - Access to sensitive data
- **Monitor Security Logs**: Regularly review logs for suspicious activity.
