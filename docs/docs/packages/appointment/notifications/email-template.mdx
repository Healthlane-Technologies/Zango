# Configuring Email Template for Notification Layout

To define the HTML template file responsible for the layout and design of email notifications without specifying content, set the `trigger_email_template` attribute in the `AppointmentView` class. This template file will govern the visual structure and styling of the email notifications sent to recipients for appointment-related information.

```python
class AppointmentView(AppointmentBaseView):
    trigger_email_template = "generic_email_template.html"
```

**Explanation:**

- The `trigger_email_template` attribute specifies the HTML template file used solely for shaping the layout and design of the email notifications.
- By setting it to `"generic_email_template.html"`, the template will determine the visual presentation, styling elements, and overall structure of the appointment notification emails.
- This configuration separates the content management from the layout design, ensuring that the emails maintain a consistent look and feel dictated by the specified HTML template file, while the dynamic content can be injected separately.
