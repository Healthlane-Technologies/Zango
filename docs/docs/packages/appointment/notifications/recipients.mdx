# Defining Notification Recipient Details

To establish the recipient details for notifications, including email addresses, phone numbers, names, etc., based on specific logic or conditions, you can override the `get_recipient_details` function within the `AppointmentView` class. This function allows customization for determining who receives notifications and how they are contacted.

```python
class AppointmentView(AppointmentBaseView):
    def get_recipient_details(self, instance):
        # Override as per your logic
        result = {}
        for participant in instance.participants:
            result.update({
                str(participant): {
                    'email': ['rajat@zelthy.com', 'amishi2407@gmail.com'],
                    'sms': '+917021640519',
                    'name': "Rajat"
                }
            })
        return result
```

**Explanation:**

- In the `get_recipient_details` function of the `AppointmentView` class, customize the logic to determine the recipient details for notifications.
- The function loops through the participants associated with the appointment instance and gathers recipient information such as email addresses, phone numbers, and names.
- Update the logic within this function to define how recipient details are selected and structured for sending notifications, ensuring that the correct contact information is utilized for email and SMS notifications based on the participants involved.
