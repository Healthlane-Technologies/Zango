# Configuring Notification Channels for Appointment Notifications

To specify the channels through which notification configurations should be sent (such as email, SMS, or both), you can define the `trigger_methods` attribute in the `AppointmentView` class. This configuration determines the communication channels used for sending appointment notifications based on the configured service providers for email and SMS.

```python
class AppointmentView(AppointmentBaseView):
    trigger_methods = ["email", "sms"]
```

**Explanation:**

- The `trigger_methods` list in the `AppointmentView` class defines the notification channels (email, SMS, or both) through which appointment notifications will be sent.
- By setting `["email", "sms"]`, the notifications will be triggered through both email and SMS channels using the configured service providers for each communication method.
- Please ensure that the appropriate service providers are configured for email and SMS to enable the notification delivery through these channels effectively for appointment reminders and updates.
