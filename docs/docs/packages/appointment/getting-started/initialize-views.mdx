# Initializing the Views

After setting up the database model for appointments, the next step is to initialize the views that will handle operations related to appointments. This includes creating, updating, listing appointments, managing workflows, and adding notes. The appointments package requires the initialization of `AppointmentTableView`, `AppointmentFormView`, and `AppointmentView`. Follow these steps to configure the views for appointments in your app:
	    
1. **Create `views.py` File**:
Within your module's folder, create a `views.py` file where you will define the views related to appointments.

2. **Initialize Appointment Table View**:
Define the `AppointmentTableView` class, which extends `AppointmentTableBase`:
```python
from ..packages.appointments.table import AppointmentTableBase
class AppointmentTableView(AppointmentTableBase):
    # Add custom methods or configurations here
```

3. **Initialize Appointment Form View**:
Define the `AppointmentFormView` class, which extends `AppointmentFormBase`:
```python
from ..packages.appointments.forms import AppointmentFormBase
class AppointmentFormView(AppointmentFormBase):
# Add custom methods or configurations here
```

4. **Initialize Appointment View**:
Define the `AppointmentView` class, which extends `AppointmentBaseView`:
```python
from ..packages.appointments.base import AppointmentBaseView
class AppointmentView(AppointmentBaseView):
# Add appointment configurations here
```

5. **Link Table and Form Views**:
In the `AppointmentView` class, link the initialized table and form views:
```python
class AppointmentView(AppointmentBaseView):
form = AppointmentFormView
table = AppointmentTableView

# Add appointment configurations here
```

Next step is to configure appointment package features within the `AppointmentView` class as needed. Refer to the Configurations section for further details.

Now you can assign a route to the `AppointmentView` and configure permissions for user roles to access the view and manage appointment data.

By initializing the views for appointments and linking the table and form views to the main `AppointmentView` class, you can efficiently manage appointments in your app. Customize the views further based on your requirements and configure permissions to control access to appointment-related functionalities for different user roles.
