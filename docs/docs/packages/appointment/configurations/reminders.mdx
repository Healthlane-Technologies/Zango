# Configuring Appointment Reminders

Appointment reminders can be set up to notify recipients about upcoming appointments at specified intervals before the appointment time. You can define multiple reminders by setting the number of hours before the appointment for each reminder in the `reminders` list.

```python
class AppointmentView(AppointmentBaseView):
    reminders = [3, 24]  # Two reminders: 3 hours and 24 hours before the appointment
```

**Explanation:**

- In the `AppointmentView` class, the `reminders` list contains the configurations for multiple reminders before the appointment time.
- Each reminder is represented as a number indicating the hours before the appointment when the reminder should be sent.
- For example, the configuration `[3, 24]` signifies two reminders: one reminder 3 hours before the appointment and another reminder 24 hours before the appointment.
- Customize the `reminders` list with the desired intervals before appointments to trigger reminder notifications for recipients, ensuring they are informed in advance of their scheduled appointments.
