# Configuring Appointment Notes with Questionnaire

To enable the attachment of a questionnaire to each appointment in the application, you can specify the questionnaire key and associate it with the `AppointmentView` class. This key links the appointment notes to a specific questionnaire defined in the Q&A package.

```python
class AppointmentView(AppointmentBaseView):
    notes_key = "appointment-notes-questionnaire-key"
```

Explanation:
- Within the `AppointmentView` class, the `notes_key` attribute is set to the specific key linking the appointment notes to the questionnaire.
- By defining the questionnaire key in this attribute, the application can associate the appointment notes with the designated questionnaire, allowing users to access and interact with the questionnaire during the appointment process.
