# Configuring Appointment Channels

To define the appointment channels or mediums through which appointments can occur, the `APPOINTMENT_TYPES` configuration needs to be specified in the `AppointmentModel` class. You can customize this tuple of tuples to include only the necessary channels for appointment scheduling.

```python
class AppointmentModel(AbstractAppointmentModel):
    F2F = 'f2f'
    VIDEO = 'video'
    AUDIO = 'audio'
    
    # Define the required appointment channels
    APPOINTMENT_TYPES = [
        (F2F, 'Face to Face'),
        (VIDEO, 'Video Call'),
        (AUDIO, 'Audio Call'),
    ]
```

Explanation:
- In the `AppointmentModel` class, the `APPOINTMENT_TYPES` tuple contains key-value pairs representing different appointment channels or mediums.
- Customize this tuple by including only the required appointment channel options, such as face-to-face, video call, and audio call.
- By focusing on the necessary appointment channels, you can streamline the selection process for users when scheduling appointments through the application.
