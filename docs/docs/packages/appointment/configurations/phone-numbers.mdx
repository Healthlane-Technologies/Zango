# Customizing Phone Numbers for Audio Call Appointments

To fetch and populate phone numbers for audio call appointments based on the participant model, you can override the `get_phone_numbers` function within the `AppointmentView` class. This function retrieves the phone numbers associated with the participant model and returns them as a list of tuples. Each tuple contains the phone number in both display and raw formats.

```python
class AppointmentView(AppointmentBaseView):
    # Other configurations and methods...

    def get_phone_numbers(self):
        '''
        If the appointment type is a phone call, override this method to populate a list of mobile numbers.
        This method should return a list of tuples, each containing the phone number in both display and raw formats.
        For example: [('+91XXXXXXXXXX', "+91XXXXXXXXXX")]
        '''
        # Custom logic to fetch phone numbers from the participant model
        # Replace the example phone number with actual data retrieval
        return [('+917021640519', '+917021640519')]
```

Explanation:
- Override the `get_phone_numbers` function in the `AppointmentView` class to fetch phone numbers for audio call appointments from the participant model.
- Customize the logic within this method to retrieve the phone numbers associated with the participants as needed.
- Return a list of tuples where each tuple contains the phone number in both display and raw formats. Update the example phone number with the actual data retrieved from the participant model.
- By modifying this function, you can ensure that the phone numbers for audio call appointments are accurately populated based on the participant's data stored in the application.
