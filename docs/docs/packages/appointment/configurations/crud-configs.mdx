# Configuring CRUD Package Settings for Appointments

Inherited from the CRUD package, the Appointments package includes CRUD-level configurations that can be customized to control the appearance and behavior of the appointment management interface. Here are the configurations and a sample method for displaying the add button:

```python
class AppointmentView(AppointmentBaseView):
    page_title = "Appointments"
    add_btn_title = "Create New Appointment"

    def display_add_button_check(self, request):
        # Provision to implement logic for displaying the add button
        return True
```

- `page_title`: Specifies the title displayed for the Appointments page within the CRUD interface.
- `add_btn_title`: Sets the title for the button that allows users to create a new appointment.
- `display_add_button_check`: This method can be overridden to implement custom logic that determines whether to display the add button based on specific conditions. It returns `True` to display the button.

For a comprehensive list of CRUD package configurations and customization options, please refer to the official CRUD package documentation. Customize these settings to enhance the user experience and functionality of the appointment management interface within your application.
