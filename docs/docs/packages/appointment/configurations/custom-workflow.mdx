# Configuring Custom Appointment Workflow

To implement a custom appointment workflow tailored to the specific requirements of your application, you can define a custom workflow class and associate it with the `AppointmentView` class. This custom workflow class can encapsulate unique statuses and transitions that align with your appointment management processes.

```python
class AppointmentView(AppointmentBaseView):
    workflow = CustomWorkflow
```

Explanation:
- In the `AppointmentView` class, the `workflow` attribute is linked to a custom workflow class `CustomWorkflow`.
- The `CustomWorkflow` class should be defined separately to manage the statuses and transitions of appointments in a way that suits the workflow needs of your application.
- By integrating a custom workflow class, you can create a tailored appointment management system with statuses and transitions that align precisely with your application's requirements.
