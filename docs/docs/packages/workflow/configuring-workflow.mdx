# Creating Workflow 

Configuration settings are essential for defining and customizing workflows according to your application's requirements. Establishing a structured workflow enables efficient management of processes and facilitates smooth operation of your application.
## Importing Workflow Dependencies

Start by importing WorkflowBase class as shown below:

```python
from ..packages.workflow.base.engine import WorkflowBase
```

## Defining Workflow Class
To configure workflows, create a class that inherits from `WorkflowBase`. This class provides the foundation for configuring status transitions, conditions, and processing methods.

```python
class PatientWorkflow(WorkflowBase):
    # Workflow configuration goes here
```
Now that you have created the workflow class, proceed to define status transitions and associated logic to further customize your workflow.
