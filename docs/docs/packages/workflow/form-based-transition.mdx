# Setting Form Based Transitions

Form-based transitions enable users to change the status of an object by providing input through a form. Here's how to implement form-based transitions within your workflow:

### 1. Importing Dependencies

Import the required dependencies for implementing form-based transitions:

```python
from ..packages.crud.forms import BaseSimpleForm
```

If your form relies on a model, import BaseForm instead of BaseSimpleForm as shown below:
```python
from ..packages.crud.forms import BaseForm
```

### 2. Creating Form with BaseForm Class
Define a form class that serves as the foundation for form-based transitions. 

```python
class UserActivateForm(BaseSimpleForm):
    reason = forms.CharField(label="Reason", max_length=100, required=True)
    date = forms.DateField(label="Date", required=True)
    file = forms.FileField(label="File", required=False)
```
### 3. Utilizing Meta
Utilize the Meta class within your form to define additional metadata such as title and field order:

```python
class UserActivateForm(BaseSimpleForm):
...
    class Meta:
        title = "Activate Customer"
        order = ["date", "reason", "file"]
```

### 4. Using Save Method
Implement the save() method within your form class to manage form processing:

```python
class UserActivateForm(BaseSimpleForm):
...
    def save(self):
        # Handle form processing here
        pass
```
### 5. Using BaseForm for Model-Based Form
If your form relies on a model, inherit from BaseForm instead of BaseSimpleForm. Here's an example:

```python
class YourModelForm(BaseForm):
    # Define your model-based form fields and Meta class here
    class Meta:
        model = YourModel
        ...
    pass
```

### 6. Defining Form-Based Transition
Specify the form class for the desired transition within your workflow class:

```python
class UserWorkflow(WorkflowBase):

    status_transitions = [
        {
            "name": "activate",
            "from": "inactive",
            "to": "active",
            "display_name": "Activate",
            "description": "Activate the User",
            "form": UserActivateForm,  # Example of BaseSimpleForm
        },
        {
            "name": "update",
            "from": "inactive",
            "to": "active",
            "display_name": "Update",
            "description": "Update the User",
            "form": YourModelForm,  # Example of BaseForm
        },
    ]
```

By following these structured steps and examples, you can effectively implement form-based transitions in your workflow, enabling users to change object statuses via form input.
