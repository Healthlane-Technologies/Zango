# Creating Tables

Zango's app development platform empowers developers to seamlessly create tables that integrate with the underlying models. This guide details the step-by-step process of constructing and configuring tables using the platform's features and functionalities.

# Import Table dependencies

Start by importing ModelTable, ModelCol from the table package and the Datamodel of your choice as shown below:

```python
from ..packages.crud.table.base import ModelTable
from ..packages.crud.table.column import ModelCol

from .models import Patient
```

# Creating table class
Begin structuring the data presentation by crafting a YourModelTable class. This class serves as the backbone for data representation and interaction, facilitating the organization and management of information in a tabular format. This would act as a foundation for subsequent CRUD operations.

```python
class PatientTable(ModelTable)
```

# Mapping table model
Leverage the Meta class within YourModelTable to customize the data model and field-specific configurations. This section empowers a nuanced control over data presentation and manipulation within the table interface.

```python
class Meta:
    model = Patient  # Replace with your actual model
```
