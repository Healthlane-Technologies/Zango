# Table Columns

Table columns define the specific attributes or fields from a data model represented within a table. Understanding and customizing table columns are essential for organizing and presenting data effectively to users.

# Defining Table Columns 
Inside the YourModelTable class, you can specify column properties to mirror your data model accurately. Here you can define types, formats, and other attributes for each column, ensuring a smooth transition from your model to the table. 

```python
class PatientTable(ModelTable):

    name = ModelCol(
        display_as='Name', 
        sortable=True, 
        searchable=True
    )
```

# Column restrictions for user roles

The user_roles key is used to specify which user roles have access to interact with the column. By defining user roles for a specific column, you can control who can see and use that column in the table. 

It is an optional attribute that you can include when defining a ModelCol or StringCol (string column) as shown below:

```python
class PatientTable(ModelTable):

    name = StringCol(
        display_as='Name', 
        sortable=True, 
        searchable=True, 
        user_roles=["Role1", "Role2"]
    )
```
