# Setting Initial Configuration

In this section, the 'CrudTestView' class is tailored to oversee the essential CRUD functionalities for a specified model. The initialization within the 'CrudTestView' class defines crucial aspects of the view interface, ensuring a seamless user experience.

### Page Title Customization
The page_title attribute serves as the title displayed on the CRUD interface, representing the managed records. Customize it to reflect the nature of the data being managed.

### Add Button Text
The add_btn_title attribute defines the text displayed on the "Add New" button within the interface. This feature enables users to seamlessly add new records to the system.

### Table and Form Assignment
Replace 'UserTableClass' and 'UserFormClass' with the appropriate classes that mirror your data model's table structure and form elements. This replacement is crucial for precise representation and interaction with your data model.

### Example

``` python
class CrudTestView(BaseCrudView):
    # Customize page title
    page_title = "User Master"

    # Customize add button text
    add_btn_title = "Add User"

    # Replace with your actual table class
    table = UserTableClass

    # Replace with your actual form class
    form = UserFormClass
```


This configuration lays the groundwork for the 'CrudTestView' class, allowing for the personalized representation of titles, button texts, and the linkage between table structure and form elements, ensuring a tailored interface for managing your specified model's data. Adjust these attributes to align seamlessly with your application's requirements and model specifics.
