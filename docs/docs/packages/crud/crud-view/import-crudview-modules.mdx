# Importing Required Modules

In your Moduleâ€™s folder, search for views.py file. Here you can initiate the setup by importing essential modules required for implementing the CRUD functionalities:

``` python
from ..packages.crud.base import BaseCrudView

from .tables import YourModelTable
from .forms import YourModelForm
```

Note: Ensure to replace ``YourModelTable`` and ``YourModelForm`` with the names of your actual table and form class respectively.
