# Creating CRUD View

The ‘CrudTestView’ class is responsible for managing the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations within the Zango application. The class configuration involves customizing essential aspects such as the page title, add button text, and linking the appropriate table and form classes to facilitate efficient data handling. 

Additionally, the section emphasizes the significance of implementing permission logic within the ‘has_add_perm’ method, ensuring that only authorized users possess the necessary rights to add new records to the system. The structured setup of this view class forms a pivotal component in enabling smooth and controlled data management within the application.
