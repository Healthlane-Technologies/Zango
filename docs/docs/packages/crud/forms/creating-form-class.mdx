# Creating a Form Class

Zango's app development platform empowers developers to seamlessly create forms that integrate with the underlying models. This guide details the step-by-step process of constructing and configuring forms using the platform's features and functionalities.

## Importing Dependencies

Start by importing BaseForm, ModelField from the form package and the Datamodel of your choice as shown below:


``` python
from ..packages.crud.forms import BaseForm
from ..packages.crud.form_fields import ModelField

from .models import User # Import model of your choice
``` 


# Creating a Form class
Now, let's begin structuring the data presentation by crafting a YourModelForm class. This class serves as the backbone for data representation and interaction, facilitating the organization and management of information in a form format. This would act as a foundation for subsequent CRUD operations.

``` python
class UserForm(BaseForm)
```


# Mapping the model

Leverage the Meta class within the form class to map the formâ€™s model with the Data model of your choice. 
``` python
 class Meta:
        model = User
```
