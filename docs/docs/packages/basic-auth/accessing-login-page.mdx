3. **Add "AnonymousUsers" Role**:
   Within the policy editing interface, add the "AnonymousUsers" role to the list of allowed roles. This will grant access to unauthenticated users.

4. **Access the Login Page**:
   Once the policy is updated, you can access the login page by navigating to the "/login" route of your application.

Following these steps will ensure that unauthenticated users are able to access the login page of your Zango application.
