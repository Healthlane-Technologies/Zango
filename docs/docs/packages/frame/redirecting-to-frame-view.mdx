   Within the detail view of the login package, find and click on the "Edit" button or option to access the edit view of the login configurations.

3. **Scroll to the Routing Section**:
   In the edit view of the login configs, scroll down or navigate to the section related to routing settings.

4. **Update Routing URL**:
   Find the routing configuration for the required user role, and change the routing URL from its previous value to "/frame/router".
