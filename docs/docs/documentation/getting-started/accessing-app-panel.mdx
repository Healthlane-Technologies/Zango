Assuming you have completed the installation and project setup process either manually or through Docker, open any browser on the local machine and navigate to the following URL:

```
http://localhost:8000/platform
```

#### Access the App Panel's Login Page:

Enter the above URL in your web browser's address bar and press "Enter." This action will take you to the login page of the App Panel.

####  Log in as an Admin:

To log in to App Panel, you'll need to use the credentials of the default platform user that you created during the project setup. Enter the following details:

- **Platform User Email Address**
- **Password**

These are the credentials you provided earlier in the project setup process.

#### Start Creating Apps:

Once you've successfully logged in, you'll have full access to App Panel as an admin user. You can now begin creating, configuring, and managing apps.
