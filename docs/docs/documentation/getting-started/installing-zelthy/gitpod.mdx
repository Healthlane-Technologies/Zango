# Using Gitpod

## About Gitpod

[Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/) is a cloud development environment (CDE) that enables you to develop your projects in a pre-configured workspace directly from your browser. With Gitpod, you can write, debug, and collaborate on your projects without the need for complex setups or installations.

Please refer to the video above and follow the steps to launch the workspace and set up the Zelthy project.

## Gitpod Workspace Terminals

#### Terminal ``URLs``

This terminal contains the available URLs that can be mapped to the apps launched in the workspace.

#### Terminal ``Setup and start the project``

In this terminal, Zelthy Docker containers are running.

You can use the following commands to start and stop the containers.

To start the containers, run
```bash
docker-compose up
```

To stop the containers, run
```bash
docker-compose down
```

## Running management commands

All the Zelthy services, such as the app server, database, Celery, and Redis, are running as Docker containers in the Gitpod workspace.


To run the management commands, you will need to enter the app container:

```bash
docker exec -it zelthy3-gitpod-sandbox-official-app-1 bash
```

Once you are in the app container, you can run the management commands from the ``zelthy_project`` directory:

Example:

```bash
gitpod@b1be57580132:/zelthy/zelthy_project$ python manage.py ws_migrate <app_name>
```


## Gitpod Notes

### Billing
The Gitpod free plan currently allows 500 free credits per month, which is 50 hours of standard workspace usage. Usage information can be found in the [Gitpod billing section](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/billing)


### Workspace Lifecycle

You can check out the Gitpod docs on [Workspace Lifecycle](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/workspaces/workspace-lifecycle)

- “Starting” & “Stopping” workspaces

- “Workplace Inactivity”: By default, workspaces stop following 30 minutes without user input (e.g. keystrokes or terminal input commands).

- Workspaces are deleted after 14 days. Pinned workspaces are never deleted automatically.

- You can pin a workspace from your workspace list in the Gitpod dashboard.
