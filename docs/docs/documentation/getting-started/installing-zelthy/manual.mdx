# Installing Zelthy: Manual Process
To get started with Zelthy, you will need to install it using the Python package manager, pip. 

Please ensure you have Python and pip installed on your system. If you haven't installed them yet, you can find Python installation instructions [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and pip installation instructions [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/).

Once Python and pip are installed, you can will need to install virtualenv to create virtual environment in which zelthy will be installed. 

```shell
pip install virtualenv
```

Now you are ready to create and activate the virtual environment by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt

```shell
virtualenv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

install the Zelthy Open Source Platform by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt

```shell
pip install zelthy3
```

This command will download and install the latest version of Zelthy Framework along with its dependencies.

### Prerequisites for Setting Up a Project

Before you embark on setting up your project with Zelthy, there are certain prerequisites that need to be met. One of the crucial prerequisites is the setup of a PostgreSQL database. Here's a brief guide on what needs to be done:

### PostgreSQL Database Setup

To get started, follow these steps to set up a PostgreSQL database:

#### 1. **Install PostgreSQL:**
   - If you haven't already, you'll need to install PostgreSQL on your system. You can download the PostgreSQL installer for your platform from the official website: [PostgreSQL Downloads](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)

#### 2. **Create a Fresh Database:**
   - Once PostgreSQL is installed, open your terminal or a PostgreSQL client.
   - Use the following command to create a new database. Replace `your_database_name` with the desired name for your project's database:
     ```
     createdb your_database_name
     ```
   - Ensure that the newly created database is fresh without any existing tables or data.

With the PostgreSQL database set up and ready to go, you can proceed with setting up your Zelthy project, confident that you have the necessary infrastructure in place.

Keep in mind that the exact steps for installing PostgreSQL may vary depending on your operating system. Be sure to consult the PostgreSQL documentation or installation guide for your specific platform if you encounter any issues during the installation process.


## Setting Up the Project

Setting up your project with Zelthy is a straightforward process. Follow these steps to create your project's root folder, initialize the project, and configure the necessary settings:

#### 1. Choose a Directory:

Navigate to the directory where you want to create your project's root folder. You can use your preferred file explorer or the command line to create and navigate to this directory.

#### 2. Install Zelthy and Start a New Project:

After installing Zelthy, you can use the `zelthy3 start-project` command to initiate the creation of a new project. Replace `"MyFirstProject"` with your preferred project name.

```bash
zelthy3 start-project "MyFirstProject"
```

#### 3. Provide Database Credentials:

During the project setup, you'll be prompted to provide your PostgreSQL database credentials. These credentials include:

- **Database Name**
- **Database Username**
- **Database Password**
- **Database Host**
- **Database Port** (default is usually 5432)

If the provided credentials are incorrect or if there are issues with the database connection, the setup process will throw errors and cancel the project creation. This is because Zelthy will create schemas and perform migrations during the project's creation.

#### 4. Migrate Schemas and Create Public Tenant:

Upon successful database connection, the setup process will automatically migrate schemas and create a public tenant. This ensures that your project is ready to go with the necessary database structure.

#### 5. Configure Default Platform User:

Next, you'll be asked to provide details for the default platform user. This user serves as the first administrator and will have access to App Panel, where you can begin creating apps. You'll need to provide the following information:

- **Platform User Email Address**
- **Password**
- **Password Confirmation**

Once you've entered these details, the setup process will create the default platform user for your project.

#### 6. Project Folder Structure and Boilerplate Code:

With all the necessary configurations in place, the setup process will proceed to create your project's folder structure and populate it with boilerplate code. You're now ready to start developing your healthcare apps within the Zelthy platform.

##### Project Structure
```plaintext
project_name/                  # Project root directory
├── manage.py                  # Django command-line utility for administrative tasks
└── project_name/              # Django project package
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── asgi.py                # ASGI config for the project
    ├── settings.py            # Project settings (database, static files, etc.)
    ├── urls_public.py         # Public URL patterns
    ├── urls_tenant.py         # Tenant-specific URL pattern
    ├── urls.py                # Project-level URL patterns
    └── wsgi.py                # WSGI config for the project
```

Follow this guide, and you'll be well on your way to creating powerful and efficient healthcare applications using Zelthy.


## Running the Development Server

Now that you've set up your project using Zelthy, the next step is to start the development server. This server allows you to access App Panel, where you can begin creating your healthcare apps. Follow these steps to run the development server:

#### 1. Navigate to Your Project Folder:

Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you created your project's root folder. You can use the `cd` (change directory) command to move to the project directory. For example:

```bash
cd path/to/your/project
```

Replace `path/to/your/project` with the actual path to your project folder.

#### 2. Start the Development Server:

Once you're inside the project folder, you can start the development server using the following command:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

This command will initiate the development server, and you'll see output indicating that the server is running. By default, the server will be available at `http://localhost:8000/`.

Running the development server is a crucial step in your project setup, as it provides you with a local environment for app development and testing.
