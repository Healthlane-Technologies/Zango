# Installing Zelthy with Docker

## Prerequisites

To begin using Zelthy through Docker installation, ensure that Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your machine. If not, follow the installation instructions for [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

## Steps

1. Clone the Zelthy3 repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zelthy/zelthy3.git
   cd zelthy3
   ```

2. Run the following command from the root folder of the project:

   ```bash
   python setup_project.py --project_dir <directory>
   ```

   You can use the `--build_core` option to build the Zelthy library

3. This creates a project named `zelthy_project` in the `zproject` folder in the specified directory.

4. Customize the project creation using optional arguments:

   ```bash
   python setup_project.py --project_name my_project --project_dir /path/to/my_project --build_core --platform_username user@example.com --platform_user_password secret --skip_build_project
   ```

   - `--project_name`: Modifies the name of the project (Default: `zelthy_project`).
   - `--project_dir`: Specifies the directory for project creation (Default: `zproject`).
   - `--build_core`: Builds the Zelthy library (Default: `False`).
   - `--platform_username`: The user email of the platform user (Default: `zelthy@mail.com`).
   - `--platform_user_password`: The password for the platform user (Default: `Zelthy@123`).

5. Navigate to ``project_dir`` to start the project.

6. Docker is started as a non root user, run the below commands to export the host UID and GID

```bash
export UID=$(id -u)
export GID=$(id -g)
```

7. Run `docker compose up` in the project directory to start the project

# Rebuilding Core

If you modify somehting in the core of the project, to rebuild it run the following command from the root of the zelthy3 project

```bash
python setup_project.py --project_dir <project_dir> --rebuild_core
```

# Syncing Static Files And Running Migrations

You can sync static files by running `python manage.py collectstatic` from the project directory in the `<project>-app-1` container. Make sure to sync the static files before deploying

You can run migrations by running `python manage.py ws_makemigrations <project_name>` and `python manage.py ws_migrate <project_name` from the project directory in the container
