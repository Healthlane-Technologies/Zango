# Initializing App Codebase

When you create an app using the App Panel, the codebase for the app is automatically initialized and organized within your project directory. Here's an overview of how the app's codebase is structured:

#### 1. Workspaces Folder

Inside your project directory, you'll find a folder named "workspaces." This folder serves as a container for all the codebases associated with the apps created within this project.

#### 2. App-Specific Folder

Within the "workspaces" folder, there will be a subfolder with the name of the app you created. This subfolder is dedicated to the codebase of the specific app.

#### 3. Codebase Files

Inside the app-specific folder, you will find the codebase files for your healthcare app. Initially, the codebase consists of two essential files:

##### a. `settings.json`

This file contains the settings and configurations specific to your app. It plays a crucial role in defining how your app behaves.

##### b. `package.json`

The `package.json` file includes information about the packages that are required for your app to function correctly. It lists the necessary components that your app relies on, ensuring that everything is in place to support the app's features and functionality.

These initial codebase files provide the foundation for your healthcare app, allowing you to further develop, customize, and expand upon the app's capabilities. You can make changes to the settings, add new components, integrate external libraries, and enhance the functionality as needed to meet the unique needs of your healthcare enterprise.
