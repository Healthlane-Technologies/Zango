# Types of Views in Zelthy

In Zelthy, views play a pivotal role in defining how your healthcare app interacts with users and processes data. These views can be broadly categorized into two main types: API Views and Template Views. Let's delve into these categories and explore their various subtypes.

## API Views

**API Views** are designed for handling requests and responses in a structured format, typically in JSON or XML. These views are instrumental in creating robust APIs to communicate with external systems or allow data exchange between different parts of your application. In Zelthy, API Views are further categorized into three main types:
