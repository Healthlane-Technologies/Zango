# Models

Zelthy Data Model is a powerful feature designed to meet the specific needs of multi-tenant systems. This innovative concept allows you to define different data models for each tenant within the same application, making Zelthy a versatile platform for building multi-tenant applications.

#### Multi-Tenant System

A multi-tenant system is an architecture where a single software application serves multiple clients, known as tenants. Each tenant operates independently within the same application, with its own data, configuration, and customizations. Multi-tenancy is commonly used in scenarios where several clients or organizations share the same software instance while keeping their data and settings isolated.

## Data Models

Models in Zelthy take the multi-tenant concept a step further. You can define unique data structures, or data models, for each tenant in your multi-tenant system. These data models can include tables, fields, relationships, and rules, allowing each tenant to have a tailored data schema that suits its specific requirements.

Key features of Data Models in Zelthy include:

#### 1. Tenant-Specific Data Structures

- Each tenant can have its own set of data models and tables.
- Custom data models can be defined and updated on the fly without affecting other tenants.

#### 2. Isolated Data

- Data for each tenant is stored separately, ensuring data security and isolation.
- Tenants cannot access or modify data structures of other tenants.

#### 3. Cost Savings

- Utilizing a single database for multiple applications reduces infrastructure costs.
- Maintenance and management are streamlined, as you manage one database instead of maintaining separate databases for each tenant.

#### 4. Scalability

- Easily scale your multi-tenant application by adding new tenants with their own data models.
- Accommodate different business needs and workflows for various clients or organizations.

#### 5. Customization

- Tenants can define and customize their data models to meet their unique requirements.
- Adapt the application to different industries, use cases, or user groups.

#### 6. Flexibility

- Developers can work on individual tenant data models independently, facilitating rapid development and updates.
- Data models can evolve as tenant needs change, ensuring long-term flexibility.

Data Models in Zelthy empower you to create versatile and cost-effective multi-tenant applications that adapt to the diverse requirements of your clients or organizations. This innovative feature sets Zelthy apart as a robust platform for building and scaling multi-tenant systems.
