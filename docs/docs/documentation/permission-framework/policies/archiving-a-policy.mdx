1. **Navigate to Policy Page:**
   Begin by accessing the "Policy" submenu within the "Permission Management" menu in App Panel. This will take you to the Policy page, displaying a comprehensive table view of all existing policies in your application.

2. **Find and Access Desired Policy:**
   Locate the policy you intend to deactivate within the policy table. Click on the policy to navigate to its details.

3. **Open Context Menu:**
   Within the policy details, locate the three dots button (ellipsis) on the rightmost end of the policy's row. Clicking on this button will open a context menu for the policy.

4. **Deactivate Policy:**
   In the context menu, click on the "Deactivate Policy" option. This action will trigger the appearance of a confirmation modal, seeking confirmation for the archival of the policy.

5. **Confirm Deactivation:**
   Within the confirmation modal, click on the "Deactivate Policy" button. This will finalize the archival process.

Upon completing these steps, the policy will be successfully archived. As a result, the policy will be removed from the users and user roles to which it was assigned. The permissions defined in the archived policy will be revoked from the associated users and user roles.
