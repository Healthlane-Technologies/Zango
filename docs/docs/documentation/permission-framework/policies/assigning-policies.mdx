# Assigning Policies

After creating policies, the next pivotal step is to utilize these policies to grant the necessary permissions to users. Zelthy offers two methods for leveraging policies to assign permissions:

## Assigning Policies to User Roles

Assigning policies to user roles is a streamlined way of granting permissions to multiple users at once.

**Advantages:**
- Efficient and centralized: Permissions defined in the policy are automatically extended to all users of the associated user role.
- Simplified management: When policy configurations change, the permissions are automatically updated for all users under the user role.

For comprehensive details on this method, refer to the [Assigning Policies to User Roles](../../user-roles/assigning-policies-to-user-roles) section.
