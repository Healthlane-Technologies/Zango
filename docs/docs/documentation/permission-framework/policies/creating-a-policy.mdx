# Creating a Policy

Creating policies is a pivotal step in configuring access control within the Zelthy platform. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to create a new policy:

1. **Creating policies.json under module:**
   Within the module folder of your app, create a file named ``policies.json``. This file will contain the policy definitions.
   
   ```plaintext
      workspaces
      ├── YourApp
      │   ├── YourModule
      │       ├── templates
      │              ├── test.html
      │       ├── views.py
      │       ├── models.py
      │       ├── urls.py
      │       └── policies.json  --> Define policies here
      ```

2. **policies.json format:**
   ```
   {
      "policies": [
            {
                  "name": "PolicyName",
                  "description": "Description of the policy",
                  "statement": {
                     "permissions": [
                        {
                              "name": "customers.views.CustomerCrudView",
                              "type": "view"
                        }
                     ]
                  }
            },
            ...
      ]
   }
   ```

   List of policies can be defined under ``policies`` key.

   **name**: Name of the policy

   **description**: Description of the policy

   **statement**: Statement of the policy. Please refer to the refer to the [Policy Config JSON](../policies/policy-config-json) section for more details on defining permissions.

Upon completing these steps, you can define the policies for the modules for your application in Zelthy. Now the next step is to Sync the policies.
