# Creating a Policy

Creating policies is a pivotal step in configuring access control within the Zelthy platform. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to create a new policy using the App Panel interface:

1. **Navigate to Policy Page:**
   Begin by accessing the "Policies" menu in App Panel. This will direct you to the Policy page, providing an overview of all existing policies within your application through a tabular format.

2. **Initiate Policy Creation:**
   On the Policy page, locate the "Add Policy +" button. Clicking on this button will open the "Add Policy" form.

3. **Fill in Details:**
   Within the "Add Policy" form, provide a suitable name and description for the new policy.

4. **Policy Configuration JSON:**
   In the same form, you'll encounter a field to input the Policy Configuration JSON. This JSON configuration dictates how the policy functions and what permissions it contains. Refer to the "Policy Config JSON" section for more details on configuring policy settings.
