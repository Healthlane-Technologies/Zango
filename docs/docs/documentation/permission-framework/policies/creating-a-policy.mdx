1. **Navigate to Policy Page:**
   Begin by accessing the "Policy" submenu within the "Permission Management" menu in App Panel. This will direct you to the Policy page, providing an overview of all existing policies within your application through a tabular format.

2. **Initiate Policy Creation:**
   On the Policy page, locate the "Add Policy +" button. Clicking on this button will open the "Add Policy" form.

3. **Fill in Details:**
   Within the "Add Policy" form, provide a suitable name and description for the new policy.

4. **Policy Configuration JSON:**
   In the same form, you'll encounter a field to input the Policy Configuration JSON. This JSON configuration dictates how the policy functions and what permissions it contains. Refer to the "Policy Config JSON" section for more details on configuring policy settings.

5. **Create Policy:**
   After completing the necessary details and configurations, click on the "Add Policy" button within the form.

Upon completing these steps, the policy will be successfully created and added as a new row in the policy view table. This policy is now ready to be assigned to user roles and users, contributing to a well-organized and secure access control framework for your healthcare applications.
