# Permission Framework

The Permission Framework within the Zelthy platform serves as a robust mechanism for managing and controlling user access to various resources such as views, databases, and more. By employing this framework, you can ensure the secure and controlled distribution of permissions throughout your healthcare enterprise applications.

## Philosophies

- **Default Restrictions:**
   The Permission Framework adheres to a principle of default restriction. In other words, every resource is inherently restricted by default. This foundational approach enhances security by requiring explicit permission assignments for access.

- **Transparency and Auditability:**
   Transparency and auditability are central tenets of the Permission Framework. Every action related to resource access is tracked and logged, providing a comprehensive audit trail. This traceability ensures accountability and facilitates the identification of potential security breaches.

## Benefits of a Permission Framework

Implementing a robust Permission Framework offers a multitude of advantages:

- **Security and Data Protection:**
   By design, the framework enhances data security. Only authorized users are granted access to sensitive resources, reducing the risk of unauthorized data exposure and breaches.

- **User Privacy:**
   The Permission Framework respects user privacy by ensuring that access to personal or confidential information is granted solely to those who require it for their designated roles.

- **Customizable Access Levels:**
   With the Permission Framework, you can tailor access levels based on roles and responsibilities. This flexibility empowers you to provide the appropriate level of access to each user or group, contributing to a seamless user experience.

- **Compliance and Regulations:**
   Healthcare applications must adhere to strict regulatory standards. The Permission Framework helps you meet compliance requirements by controlling access to patient data and other sensitive information.

- **Reduced Human Errors:**
   By restricting access to resources by default, the Permission Framework minimizes the risk of accidental or unintended changes. This proactive approach reduces the likelihood of human errors that could have significant consequences.
