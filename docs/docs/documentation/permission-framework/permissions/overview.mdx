# Permissions

Permissions serve as fundamental building blocks within the Zelthy platform, functioning as gateways that regulate access to specific resources based on predefined rules. These rules are integral to ensuring the right individuals interact with the appropriate components of healthcare applications. A permission essentially acts as a "key" that users must possess to unlock certain functionalities or data sets.

## Understanding Permissions

When a user attempts to interact with a particular resource—such as viewing a patient's medical records or accessing a specific data model—a permission comes into play. Think of permissions as authorization tickets that users must possess to enter different areas of the application. These permissions are meticulously crafted to align with the diverse roles, responsibilities, and functionalities within the healthcare ecosystem.

## Role of Permissions

At its core, a permission is an object that encapsulates the necessary requirements to access a designated resource. For instance, consider a "Patient DataModel" permission. This permission establishes the prerequisite for users who wish to access the data stored within the patient data model. Permissions are engineered to be granular, allowing for fine-tuned control over what users can and cannot do within the application.

## Permission Types

Permissions come in various types to accommodate different access scenarios:

- **View Permission:** Governs access to specific URLs, dictating where users can navigate and what they can view.
- **DataModel Permission:** Regulates interactions with data models, ensuring authorized users can work with particular datasets or databases.
- **UserAccess Permission:** Provides the essential access required for any user to enter the application.
- **Custom Permission:** Offers the flexibility to define specialized access criteria beyond standard categories, catering to unique use cases.

By understanding the role and types of permissions, you establish a solid foundation for controlling access, enhancing security, and crafting a tailored user experience within your healthcare applications.

## Role of Policies in Initializing Permissions

Permissions come to life through policies—a mechanism within the Zelthy platform that sets the stage for who can access what. Policies orchestrate the allocation of permissions to user roles, defining the authorization landscape for users and resources.

## Configurable Permission Settings

Permissions carry a configurational dimension, allowing you to tailor their behavior to suit specific needs. During permission initialization, you have the option to configure settings that influence how the permission operates. This configurability empowers you to fine-tune access control and resource interactions.
