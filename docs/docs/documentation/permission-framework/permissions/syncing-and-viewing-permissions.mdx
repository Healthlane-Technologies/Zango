# Syncing and Viewing Permissions

Ensuring the visibility and accuracy of permissions is vital within the Zelthy platform. Permissions are automatically created to regulate access, but to make them visible in App Panel, a syncing process is required. Here's how you can view permissions and synchronize them to reflect the latest codebase changes:

## Viewing Permissions

- **Navigate to Permission Management:**
   Within App Panel, access the "Permission Management" menu and select the "Permissions" submenu.

- **Access the Permissions Page:**
   Upon selecting the "Permissions" submenu, you'll be directed to the Permissions page. This page presents a table view displaying all available permissions.

:::note
It's important to recognize that not all permissions may be immediately visible. This is because App Panel might not yet be synced to display the latest set of permissions.

## Syncing Permissions

- **Access Permission Management:**
   Begin by accessing the "Permission Management" menu within App Panel.

- **Navigate to Permissions:**
   Within the "Permission Management" menu, click on the "Permissions" submenu.

- **Initiate Sync Process:**
   On the Permissions page, you'll find a "Sync" button. Click on this button to initiate the synchronization process.

- **Sync in Progress:**
   After clicking the "Sync" button, the screen will indicate that the system is actively syncing permissions from the updated codebase. The synchronization process ensures that the permissions within App Panel are up to date.

- **Updated Permissions Display:**
   Once the synchronization is complete, the table on the Permissions page will display the updated list of permissions. This list may include newly added permissions or any that have been removed based on the changes made in the codebase.

The synchronization process ensures that your permissions within App Panel accurately represent the latest set of permissions from your codebase. By staying synced and up-to-date, you maintain an organized and secure access control system within your healthcare applications.
