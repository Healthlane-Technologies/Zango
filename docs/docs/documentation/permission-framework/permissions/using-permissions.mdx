# Using Permissions

Permissions are fundamental elements for controlling access to resources within the Zango platform. They're harnessed through policies, enabling a robust access control system. Each type of permission is accompanied by configurable parameters that offer fine-grained control over resource interactions.

## Configurable Parameters in Permission Initialization

When initializing permissions within policies, you have the ability to configure various parameters. These configurations are specified using JSON, allowing you to tailor permissions to align with your specific access requirements.

## Types of Permissions and Their Configurations

### 1. View Permission
   This type of permission does not involve any additional configuration. It simply enables access to specific URLs.

### 2. User Access Permission
The User Access Permission is a foundational permission that allows any user to enter the application. It does not involve any configuration.

By leveraging permissions with tailored configurations, you optimize security, streamline workflows, and align access control with the specific needs of your business applications.
