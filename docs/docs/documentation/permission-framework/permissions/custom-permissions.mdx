# Custom Permissions

Custom permissions offer developers the flexibility to define bespoke access rules for resources beyond views and data models. This empowers you to finely tailor access control to specific use cases. Here's how custom permissions are created, defined, and utilized:

## Creation of Custom Permissions

1. **Navigate to Permission Management:**
   Within App Panel, access the "Permission Management" menu and select the "Permissions" submenu.

2. **Access the Permissions Page:**
   Upon selecting the "Permissions" submenu, you'll be directed to the Permissions page. This page presents a table view displaying all available permissions.

3. **Add Custom Permission:**
   On the Permissions page, locate the "Custom Permission +" button. Clicking on this button will open the "Add Custom Permission" form.

4. **Fill in Details:**
   Within the "Add Custom Permission" form, provide a suitable name and description for the custom permission.

5. **Create Custom Permission:**
   Click on the "Add Custom Permission" button within the form. This action will finalize the creation of the custom permission.

Upon completion of these steps, the custom permission will be successfully created and displayed within the permissions table.

## Definition and Usage of Custom Permission

Custom permissions hold significance in the logic and functionality defined by developers in the codebase. These permissions can be customized to align with specific requirements and access scenarios.

Custom configurations can be integrated into the custom permission logic, allowing developers to tailor the behavior of the custom permission to match the intricacies of the application's use cases.

By leveraging custom permissions, developers extend the platform's capabilities by crafting access controls that align precisely with unique application requirements. The flexibility to define and integrate custom permissions enriches the application's functionality and ensures that access is meticulously managed according to custom-defined rules.
