# Creating an Async Task

In Zelthy, asynchronous tasks are defined as functions within a `tasks.py` file located inside any module folder of your application. These tasks leverage the `@shared_task` function decorator to indicate that they should be executed asynchronously.

#### Steps to Create an Async Task

1. **Create a `tasks.py` File**: Within the module folder of your app, create a file named `tasks.py`. This file will contain the definition of your asynchronous tasks.

2. **Define the Task Function**: Inside the `tasks.py` file, define your asynchronous task as a regular Python function. Use the `@shared_task` decorator from Zelthy to mark the function as an asynchronous task.

```python
# tasks.py

from celery import shared_task

@shared_task
def my_async_task():
    # Task logic goes here
    pass
```

3. **Implement Task Logic**: Within the task function, write the logic that you want to execute asynchronously. This could include database operations, API calls, file processing, or any other computationally intensive or time-consuming tasks.

4. **Repeat as Needed**: You can define any number of asynchronous tasks within the `tasks.py` file. Each task should be defined as a separate function with the `@shared_task` decorator.

By following these steps, you can create and define asynchronous tasks in Zelthy, allowing you to offload time-consuming operations and improve the overall performance and responsiveness of your application.
