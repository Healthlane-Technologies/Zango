Upon successful deactivation, you will receive a confirmation notification, and the status of the user role will be changed to "Inactive." It's important to note that once a user role is deactivated:

- Existing users associated with this user role will no longer be able to log in using it.
- New users cannot be created with this user role.

This control over user roles ensures that your healthcare enterprise maintains an organized and secure user access structure, adapting to changing requirements and safeguarding sensitive information.
