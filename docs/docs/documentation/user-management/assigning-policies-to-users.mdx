# Assigning Policies to Users

Granting specific permissions to users through policies is a valuable feature in the User Management system of App Panel. This capability enables administrators and developers to provide customized access and permissions at a user level, allowing for precise control based on individual needs. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to assign policies to users:

1. **Navigate to User Management Page:**
   Begin by clicking on the "User Management" menu in App Panel. This action will take you to the User Management page.

2. **Locate the User:**
   On the User Management page, find the user to whom you intend to assign the policy. Identify the user by scrolling through the list or using search and filter options.

3. **Access User Context Menu:**
   In the user's row, you'll see a three dots button (ellipsis) on the rightmost end. Click on this button to open the context menu.

4. **Edit User Details:**
   From the context menu, select the "Edit User Details" option. This will open the "Edit User Details" form.

5. **Modify Policies:**
   Within the "Edit User Details" form, you'll find a policy field with a multi-select dropdown. Use this dropdown to add or remove policies as required for the user.

6. **Save Changes:**
   After making the necessary policy changes, click on the "Save" button to update and save the user's details along with the modified policies.

Following these steps will result in the user having the assigned policies reflected in the User Management table, specifically in the "Policies" column. Assigning policies to users beyond their user roles empowers administrators and developers with the flexibility to provide tailored access and permissions, ensuring that users have the precise level of control needed for their responsibilities within your healthcare applications.
