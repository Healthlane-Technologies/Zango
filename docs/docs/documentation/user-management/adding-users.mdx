Here's a step-by-step guide on how to add users:

1. **Navigate to User Management Page:**
   Start by clicking on the "User Management" menu in App Panel. This action will redirect you to the User Management page.

Upon completing these steps, the new user will be successfully added to the application. The entered details, along with the designated user role and assigned policies, will be incorporated into the user's profile. This streamlined process ensures that new users have the appropriate access and permissions tailored to their roles and responsibilities within your healthcare applications.
