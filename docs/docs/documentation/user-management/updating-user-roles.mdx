In the App Panel User Management system, you have the flexibility to modify user roles for users, allowing for refined access control. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to change user roles for a user:

1. **Navigate to User Management Page:**
   Begin by clicking on the "User Management" menu in App Panel. This action will direct you to the User Management page.
