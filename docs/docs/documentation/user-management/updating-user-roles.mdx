   From the context menu, choose the "Edit User Details" option. This action will open the "Edit User Details" form.

5. **Modify User Roles:**
   Inside the "Edit User Details" form, locate the user role field with a multi-select dropdown. Utilize this dropdown to add or remove user roles, adjusting the user's role access as needed.

6. **Save Changes:**
   After effecting the desired user role changes, click on the "Save" button to commit the updates and save the user's details along with the adjusted user roles.

Upon completing these steps, the User Management table will display the modified user role access in the "Role Access" column. The user's permissions to various resources will be updated according to the new user role(s).
