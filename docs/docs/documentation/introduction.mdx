### Overview

Zelthy is a web application development framework built upon Django, designed to accelerate the development of custom business apps.


The key tenets of Zelthy are:
 - Leverage the stengths of Django, an already proven and battle tested web framework
 - Make available the basics of business web apps as part of the framework
 - Natively multi-tenant - Host multiple apps from a single deployment
 - Security & Compliances are built in. 
 - Suite of essential packages to serve as the building blocks of Apps
 - Use case packages to build the industry specific use cases

### What are custom business app?
<p>
Custom Business Apps are apps that are needed to support business workflows and processes that are not normally supported by available ERPs, CRMs, SaaS, etc. The main reason for this is the uniqueness of workflows to the specific business. Because of the unique requirement, these apps are often required to be developed from scratch.</p>
<p>
No Code/ Low Code platform are considered by many as good solution for these types of apps but in our opinion these platforms suffer with a limitation of customizability.</p>

### Our Core Principles
Zelthy framework is architecured keeping in mind the key requirements of business applications. The fundamental principles that guides the development of the framework are:
- Speed of development is paramount for business apps
- Limitations around customizability should not stifle business innovation
- Secuity & Compliance should not need reinventing by the app's dev teams 
- Interoperability is core for business apps
- A median business app might become unsustainable without shared infrastructure and DevOps cost 
- With the advent of AI, app development patterns that rely on contextual coding is expected to become more efficient that the one relying on gui based configurations.
